# Changes in PHPUnit 8.4

All notable changes of the PHPUnit 8.4 release series are documented in this file using the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## [8.4.0] - 2019-10-04

### Added

* Implemented [#3775](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/3775): Explicit API for expecting PHP errors, warnings, and notices

### Changed

* The method `expectExceptionMessageRegExp()` is now deprecated. There is no behavioral change in this version of PHPUnit. Using this method will trigger a deprecation warning in PHPUnit 9 and in PHPUnit 10 it will be removed. Please use `expectExceptionMessageMatches()` instead.
