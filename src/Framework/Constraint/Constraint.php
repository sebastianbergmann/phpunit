    /**
     * Reduces the sub-expression starting at $this by skipping degenerate

     * a non-reducible sub-expression
     *
     * Returns $this for terminal constraints and for operators that start
     * non-reducible sub-expression, or the nearest descendant of $this that
     * starts a non-reducible sub-expression.
     *
     * A constraint expression may be modelled as a tree with non-terminal
     * nodes (operators) and terminal nodes. For example:
     *
     *      LogicalOr           (operator, non-terminal)
     *      + LogicalAnd        (operator, non-terminal)
     *      | + IsType('int')   (terminal)
     *      | + GreaterThan(10) (terminal)
     *      + LogicalNot        (operator, non-terminal)
     *        + IsType('array') (terminal)
     *
     * A degenerate sub-expression is a part of the tree, that effectively does
     * not contribute to the evaluation of the expression it appears in. An example
     * of degenerate sub-expression is a BinaryOperator constructed with single
     * operand or nested BinaryOperators, each with single operand. An
     * expression involving a degenerate sub-expression is equivalent to a
     * reduced expression with the degenerate sub-expression removed, for example
     *
     *      LogicalAnd          (operator)
     *      + LogicalOr         (degenerate operator)
     *      | + LogicalAnd      (degenerate operator)
     *      |   + IsType('int') (terminal)
     *      + GreaterThan(10)   (terminal)
     *
     * is equivalent to
     *
     *      LogicalAnd          (operator)
     *      + IsType('int')     (terminal)
     *      + GreaterThan(10)   (terminal)
     *
     * because the subexpression
     *
     *      + LogicalOr
     *        + LogicalAnd
     *          + -
     *
     * is degenerate. Calling reduce() on the LogicalOr object above, as well
     * as on LogicalAnd, shall return the IsType('int') instance.
     *
     * Other specific reductions can be implemented, for example cascade of
     * LogicalNot operators
     *
     *      + LogicalNot
     *        + LogicalNot
     *          +LogicalNot
     *           + IsTrue
     *
     * can be reduced to
     *
     *      LogicalNot
     *      + IsTrue
