Subject: [PATCH] t/PHPUnit/GW/Fix_test_suite_class_name_detection

Fixing a class name detection problem similar to
https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/71

When running "phpunit AllTests.php" on a Horde test suite file PHPUnit
identifies the class we extend from as our test suite class.

The patch uses reflection to ensure the detected class is actually
defined in the file that has been loaded.
