## Installation

We distribute a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](https://php.net/phar) that has all required (as well as some optional) dependencies of PHPUnit bundled in a single file:

```bash
$ wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar

$ chmod +x phpunit.phar

$ mv phpunit.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit
```

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it, of course:

```bash
$ wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar

$ php phpunit.phar
```

Alternatively, you may use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to download and install PHPUnit as well as its dependencies. Please refer to the [documentation](https://phpunit.de/documentation.html) for details on how to do this.
