# PHPUnit

PHPUnit is the de-facto standard for unit testing in PHP projects. It provides both a framework that makes the writing of tests easy as well as the functionality to easily run the tests and analyse their results.

## Requirements

* PHPUnit 3.8 requires PHP 5.4.7 (or later).
* [PHP_CodeCoverage](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage), the library that is used by PHPUnit to collect and process code coverage information, depends on [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) 2.2.1 (or later).

## Installation

There are three supported ways of installing PHPUnit.

You can use the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.cli.php) or [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to download and install PHPUnit as well as its dependencies. You can also download a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](http://php.net/phar) of PHPUnit that has all required (as well as some optional) dependencies of PHPUnit bundled in a single file.

### PEAR Installer

The following two commands (which you may have to run as `root`) are all that is required to install PHPUnit using the PEAR Installer:

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit

### Composer

To add PHPUnit as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `phpunit/phpunit` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a development-time dependency on PHPUnit 3.7:

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phpunit/phpunit": "3.7.*"
        }
    }

### PHP Archive (PHAR)

    wget http://pear.phpunit.de/get/phpunit.phar
    chmod +x phpunit.phar
