PHPUnit
=======

PHPUnit is the de-facto standard for unit testing in PHP projects. It provides both a framework that makes the writing of tests easy as well as the functionality to easily run the tests and analyse their results.

Requirements
------------

* PHPUnit 3.8 requires PHP 5.4.7 (or later).
* [PHP_CodeCoverage](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage), the library that is used by PHPUnit to collect and process code coverage information, depends on [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) 2.2.1 (or later).

Installation
------------

PHPUnit should be installed using the PEAR Installer, the backbone of the [PHP Extension and Application Repository](http://pear.php.net/) that provides a distribution system for PHP packages.

Depending on your OS distribution and/or your PHP environment, you may need to install PEAR or update your existing PEAR installation before you can proceed with the following instructions. `sudo pear upgrade PEAR` usually suffices to upgrade an existing PEAR installation. The [PEAR Manual ](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php) explains how to perform a fresh installation of PEAR.

The following two commands (which you may have to run as `root`) are all that is required to install PHPUnit using the PEAR Installer:

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit

After the installation you can find the PHPUnit source files inside your local PEAR directory; the path is usually `/usr/lib/php/PHPUnit`.
